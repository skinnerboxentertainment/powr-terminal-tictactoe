# AutoMagically Testing

This skill defines the testing strategy for the project. All test code must
follow these patterns. Tests live under `tests/` mirroring `src/` structure:

```
tests/
  unit/            — fast, no browser, no PixiJS
  integration/     — scene lifecycle, input, audio, resize
  browser/         — Playwright, Chromium, headless
  visual/          — Playwright screenshot comparisons (sparse)
  helpers/         — shared factories, mocks, assertions
```

---

## 1. Testing Pyramid

### Unit Tests (80% of tests)

Test game logic in isolation. No browser, no PixiJS rendering.

```typescript
// tests/unit/gameplay/player-state.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest"
import { PlayerState } from "../../../src/gameplay/player-state"

describe("PlayerState", () => {
  it("takes damage and reduces health", () => {
    const state = new PlayerState()
    state.takeDamage(25)
    expect(state.health).toBe(75)
  })

  it("clamps health to zero", () => {
    const state = new PlayerState({ health: 10 })
    state.takeDamage(100)
    expect(state.health).toBe(0)
  })
})
```

What to unit test:
- State transitions (health, inventory, score, progression)
- Collision decisions (does entity A hit entity B?)
- Formulas (damage = attack - defense, crit rolls)
- Spawn logic (what spawns, where, how many)
- Save/load round-trip (toJSON → fromJSON → match)
- Seeded RNG (same seed → same sequence)

### Integration Tests (15% of tests)

Test interactions between systems. Vitest with jsdom environment.

```typescript
// tests/integration/scene-lifecycle.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest"
import { GameScene } from "../../src/scenes/game-scene"

describe("GameScene", () => {
  it("creates and destroys without leaking", () => {
    const scene = new GameScene()
    scene.enter()
    scene.exit()
    // verify no ticker callbacks, no DOM listeners remain
  })
})
```

What to integration test:
- Scene lifecycle (enter/exit, no leaks)
- InputManager frame capture
- Resize behavior
- Audio command routing
- Asset failure handling

### Browser Tests (4% of tests)

Playwright in headless Chromium. Test real browser behavior.

```typescript
// tests/browser/startup.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test"

test("game loads and renders canvas", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:5173")
  await page.waitForSelector("canvas")
  expect(await page.locator("canvas").isVisible()).toBe(true)
})
```

What to browser test:
- Game loads and renders
- Pointer and keyboard interaction work
- Pause/resume cycle
- Fullscreen toggle
- Focus-loss handling

### Visual Tests (1% of tests)

Playwright screenshot comparisons. Sparse and intentional.

```typescript
// tests/visual/menu.test.ts
test("main menu renders correctly", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:5173")
  await page.waitForSelector("canvas")
  await expect(page.locator("canvas")).toHaveScreenshot("main-menu.png")
})
```

What to visually test:
- Main menu (one stable contract)
- Representative gameplay state (one scene)
- HUD layout
- Game-over state

Do NOT visually test:
- Animations (will never match frame-perfect)
- Particle effects (non-deterministic)
- Content that changes per playthrough

---

## 2. Deterministic Testing

Game logic must be testable without a browser or real clock.

### Fake Clock

```typescript
// tests/helpers/fake-clock.ts
export class FakeClock {
  private _time = 0
  get time(): number { return this._time }
  advance(ms: number): void { this._time += ms }
  reset(): void { this._time = 0 }
}
```

Pass `FakeClock` to systems that need timing. Never call `Date.now()`,
`performance.now()`, or `requestAnimationFrame` directly in game logic.

### Seeded RNG

```typescript
// tests/helpers/seeded-rng.ts
export function createSeededRNG(seed: number) {
  let s = seed
  return {
    next(): number {
      s = (s * 16807 + 0) % 2147483647
      return (s - 1) / 2147483646
    },
  }
}
```

Always use seeded RNG in game logic. Same seed → same sequence →
deterministic tests.

---

## 3. What NOT to Test Through Pixels

Never test game logic by checking rendered pixel output.

```typescript
// WRONG — testing logic through rendering
// await expect(canvas).toHaveScreenshot("player-took-damage.png")

// CORRECT — test the state directly
player.takeDamage(25)
expect(player.health).toBe(75)
```

- State changes → unit tests
- Rendering changes → visual tests (sparse)
- If a bug manifests visually, write a unit test for the *underlying state change*,
  not a screenshot of the visual artifact.

---

## 4. Test Helpers Convention

Shared helpers live in `tests/helpers/`:

- `factories.ts` — create game objects with sensible defaults
- `mocks.ts` — mock event bus, mock audio manager
- `assertions.ts` — custom vitest matchers (e.g., `expectInRange`)
- `seeded-rng.ts` — deterministic randomness
- `fake-clock.ts` — deterministic time

---

## 5. Coverage Target

- **Unit tests**: 80% line coverage on `src/gameplay/` and `src/core/` logic
- **Integration tests**: all scene lifetime paths enter/exit without error
- **Browser tests**: startup smoke test, one interaction path
- **Visual tests**: no coverage target — maintained manually for stability

Do not enforce coverage on `src/ui/` or `src/audio/` — those are better
validated through manual review and browser tests.
