# AutoMagically Game Architecture

This skill defines the structural rules that every game system must follow.
Apply these when writing or reviewing any code under `src/`.

---

## 1. State Ownership

Game simulation state must live in plain TypeScript classes or records,
**never** on PixiJS display object properties.

```typescript
// CORRECT — state on a plain class
class PlayerState {
  health = 100
  position = { x: 0, y: 0 }
  inventory: string[] = []
}

// Render pass syncs display to state
function syncPlayerDisplay(player: PlayerState, sprite: Sprite) {
  sprite.position.set(player.position.x, player.position.y)
}

// WRONG — state on a Sprite
sprite.health = 100          // no
sprite.playerData = { ... }  // no
```

This is the single most important rule. Violating it produces code that is
untestable, impossible to save/load, and tightly coupled to the renderer.

---

## 2. Scene Lifecycle

Use a stack-based scene manager. Each scene follows this contract:

```
enter()     → create display objects, subscribe to input, start audio
update(dt)  → run game logic for one frame
exit()      → destroy display objects, unsubscribe, stop audio
```

Rules:
- Scenes own their display objects. `enter()` creates them, `exit()` destroys them.
- Scenes do not own the PixiJS `Application` or `InputManager` — those live at the app level.
- Scene transitions: push (pause current, start new), pop (destroy top, resume previous), replace (destroy current, start new).

Example scene:

```typescript
class MenuScene implements Scene {
  private container = new Container()

  enter(): void {
    app.stage.addChild(this.container)
    // create menu sprites, add to container
  }

  update(dt: number): void {
    // check input, animate menu items
  }

  exit(): void {
    this.container.removeFromParent()
    this.container.destroy({ children: true })
  }
}
```

---

## 3. Update Loop

Use variable delta with PixiJS v8 `Ticker`:

```typescript
app.ticker.add((ticker) => {
  const dt = ticker.deltaTime  // fraction of target frame (1.0 = 60fps)
  update(dt)
})
```

- `dt` is a float where 1.0 = one frame at 60fps. Multiply speeds by `dt`.
- If deterministic physics/replay is needed later, wrap this in a fixed-step accumulator.
- Start with variable delta. Add fixed-step only when gameplay demands it.

---

## 4. Input Handling

A single `InputManager` captures all input states once per frame:

```typescript
class InputManager {
  readonly keys = new Set<string>()
  readonly keysJustPressed = new Set<string>()
  readonly mouse = { x: 0, y: 0, left: false }

  update(): void {
    // called once per frame before scene.update()
    // captures current keyboard, mouse, touch, gamepad state
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Scenes read from `InputManager` — they never register their own DOM event listeners.
- This simplifies pausing (clear input on pause), focus-loss (clear on blur), and input remapping.
- `update()` is called once per frame, before any scene's `update()`.

---

## 5. Composition Model

Use plain classes with clear dependencies. Not ECS.

```typescript
class Player {
  readonly state = new PlayerState()
  private sprite: Sprite

  constructor(sprite: Sprite) {
    this.sprite = sprite
  }

  update(dt: number, input: InputManager): void {
    // read input, update state
    // sync sprite to state
  }
}
```

- ECS overhead is not justified for solo/small-team projects.
- If composition becomes painful (cross-cutting systems, data-driven entities),
  migrate to ECS later. Do not start there.

---

## 6. Project Structure

```
src/
  main.ts               — PixiJS Application init, game loop, scene manager
  core/                  — SceneManager, InputManager
  scenes/                — BootScene, MenuScene, GameScene, etc.
  gameplay/              — Player, Enemy, Projectile, systems
  ui/                    — HUD, menus, overlays
  input/                 — InputManager, input bindings
  audio/                 — Howler.js wrapper, sound manager
  data/                  — Static data: levels, enemy configs, loot tables
  utils/                 — Math helpers, object pooling, seeded RNG
```

Rules:
- `core/` has zero imports from `gameplay/`, `scenes/`, or `ui/`.
- `gameplay/` can import from `core/` and `input/` but not `ui/`.
- `ui/` can import from `core/` and `input/` but not `gameplay/`.

---

## 7. Save/Load

State objects implement `toJSON()` / `fromJSON()`:

```typescript
class PlayerState {
  toJSON(): object {
    return { health: this.health, inventory: this.inventory }
  }

  static fromJSON(data: object): PlayerState {
    const s = new PlayerState()
    s.health = data.health ?? 100
    s.inventory = data.inventory ?? []
    return s
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Serialize to JSON. Store in `localStorage`.
- No binary formats. No schema migrations yet.
- Add versioning only when the project requires breaking changes.

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Never generate:

- `new Application()` inside a scene or gameplay class — init once in `main.ts`.
- State stored on `Sprite`, `Container`, or any PixiJS display object.
- DOM event listeners registered by scenes — use `InputManager`.
- `setInterval` or `setTimeout` for game logic — use `Ticker`.
- Direct references from `gameplay/` to `ui/` — use events or callbacks.
- Strings where enums or union types capture the domain.
